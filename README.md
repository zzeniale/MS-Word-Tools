### A small collection of scripts for Microsoft Word
---
These are two of the scripts I made to automate repetitive and error-prone steps in report-writing:

#### 1. InsertPhotos
Prompts the user to select a directory, and insert all photos from directory into a table in a word document. Useful for inserting large amounts of photos or graphics.

#### 2. ColourCells
Colours cells in a table differently according to the values in them. First prompts the user to select a document that contains a table of values. Useful for creating visual representations of metrics (e.g. red for negative numbers, blue for zeros, green for positive numbers).
